console.log("Hello yes");
//for single line comments
/*for multi line comments
like this*/

//syntax for declaring variable is easy as we just have to write the statement
//let x= 5;
//where let is a keyword
let a=5;
console.log(a);
const b = 5 ;
console.log(b);

let $x="BRUH";
let $y = $x;
console.log($y);
//variable name i.e. identifiers can begin with a $
// the latest value is always stored in the variable name for ex
var p="Kira " ;
var p="Yoshikage";
console.log(p);
// this only works when the variable has been intialised by var rather than using the "let" keyword
